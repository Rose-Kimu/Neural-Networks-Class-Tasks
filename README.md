# Neural Networks Class Tasks (Assignment Solutions)

Welcome to the Neural Networks Class Tasks repository! This repository contains solutions to tasks and assignments given by my professor related to neural networks. These tasks are designed to help students to  understand fundamental concepts and practices in neural network development.

## Contents

This repository is organized into chapters, each containing specific tasks related to different aspects of neural networks. Here's a brief overview of the contents:

- **Chap01**: Tasks related to background mathematics for neural networks.
- **Chap02**: Tasks focused on supervised learning techniques.
- **Chap03**: Tasks covering various activation functions used in neural networks.
- **Chap05**: Tasks specifically addressing multiclass cross-entropy loss.
- **Chap06**: Tasks related to the Adam optimization algorithm.
- **Chap07**: Tasks covering initialization techniques for neural networks.

Each chapter contains Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) corresponding to individual tasks.
